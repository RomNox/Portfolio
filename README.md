## 🌟 About the Project

This repository is a portfolio showcasing my skills in **test automation** and **FullStack development**. It includes the following sections:

- **Project Folders (myCases):**  
  The *myCases* folder contains individual directories with projects that demonstrate my technical capabilities. Each project has its own unique build system and separate documentation, so they cannot be run directly. However, you can review the source code to familiarize yourself with the technologies and approaches used.

- **Portfolio Website:**  
  A dynamic one-page website that serves as my digital business card, which also partly demonstrates my web development skills. The site is built using modern web technologies, enabling adaptive and animated interfaces.

- **Diplomas, Certifications & Resume:**  
  This section includes documents that verify my qualifications in QA and FullStack development. You will find certificates from specialized courses, diplomas, and a detailed resume outlining the key milestones of my professional career.
