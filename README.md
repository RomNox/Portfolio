## 🌟 About the Project

This repository is a portfolio that demonstrates my skills in **QA Automation** and **FullStack Development**. It includes:

- **Project Folders:** Individual directories containing projects that showcase my technical abilities.  
  *Note: Each project uses its own build tools, so running them directly from this repository is not supported.*
- **Portfolio Website:** A dynamic, one-page site that acts as my digital business card and a live demonstration of my web development and animation skills.
- **Diplomas & Resume:** Documents that verify my qualifications, including my certificates in QA and FullStack development.
