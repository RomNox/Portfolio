## 🌟 About the Project

**Task and Project Management System** is a **console-based Java application** designed for managing projects and tasks within a team.  
The system allows users to **create projects, assign team members, manage tasks, track progress, set priorities, and communicate through comments**.

📝 **Project Type:** Console Application  
💡 **Core Features:** User, Project, and Task Management

### 🎯 **My Role in the Project**
I, **Vladimir Romaikin**, played a **key role** in this project as both **the lead developer and project manager**.  
My responsibilities included:  
✔ **Architecting the project structure**  
✔ **Developing the data layer and business logic**  
✔ **Integrating all components**  
✔ **Managing the team and task distribution**

The project was developed **for educational purposes**, demonstrating **object-oriented programming principles, software architecture, and command-line user interaction**.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project follows a **three-layer architecture**:  
1️⃣ **Data Layer** – Manages data storage.  
2️⃣ **Business Layer** – Processes data and contains the application's core logic.  
3️⃣ **User Interface (UI) Layer** – Provides a console-based interaction system.

### **Core Components**

| Component               | Description |
|-------------------------|------------|
| `UserAppDemo.java`      | Entry point for the application. |
| `UserMenu.java`         | Console-based menu for user interaction. |
| `ProjectService.java`   | Business logic for project management. |
| `TaskService.java`      | Handles task creation, assignment, and status updates. |
| `UserService.java`      | Manages user authentication and interactions. |
| **Repositories**        | `UserRepository`, `ProjectRepository`, `TaskRepository` – Manage data storage. |
| **DTOs**               | `UserDto.java`, `ProjectDto.java`, `TaskDto.java` – Data transfer between layers. |
| **Entities**           | `User.java`, `Project.java`, `Task.java`, `Comment.java`, `Priority.java`, `Status.java` – Core data models. |
