## 🌟 About the Project  

This project was created as part of the **final stage of the software testing course** and is **educational**. We,  
the **Students Team**, conducted **comprehensive testing** of the **PetSitters** platform, developed as an **educational web application**.

📝 **Platform:** [PetSitters Service](https://pets-care-u2srs.ondigitalocean.app/#/)  
🐶 **Purpose:** A service for searching and booking pet care services.  
💡 **Features:** User registration, booking services, profile management, reviews, and ratings.

Our main goal was to **test this project from different aspects**, using various **testing methodologies**, modern tools, and working through **the full testing cycle** from requirements analysis to reporting.

## 🛠 Our Approach to Testing  

We used a **structured and systematic** approach based on **best testing practices**:

1. **Requirements Analysis** – Reviewed specifications and analyzed the system using the **FURPS model** (Functionality, Usability, Reliability, Performance, Supportability).  
2. **Test Documentation** – Developed a **test plan, test cases, and checklists** to verify functional and non-functional requirements.  
3. **Functional Testing** – Tested core user flows: **registration, login, booking, profile management, and payments**.  
4. **API Testing** – Used **Postman & Newman** to check API endpoints for correctness, security, and error handling.  
5. **UI/UX Testing** – Checked usability, design compliance, and responsiveness across devices.  
6. **Load Testing** – **Artillery** was used to evaluate system performance under high load.  
7. **Automated Testing** – Developed **Selenium WebDriver + JUnit** tests and implemented **CI/CD with Jenkins**.  
8. **Reporting** – Used **Allure for test reports** and documented bugs in **Jira**.
